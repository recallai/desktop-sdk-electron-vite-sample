# Recall.ai Desktop SDK Electron Example

This is a minimal example application which can get you started quickly, and is ready to run `npm start` and `npm run make` on! This repo is intended to be used as a template for you to start off with. If you want a more feature-complete example application, take a look at [Muesli.](https://github.com/recallai/muesli-public)

## Setup

Modify `.env` to include your Recall.ai API key:

```
API_KEY=<your key>
```

**NOTE**: In a production application, you'd keep your API keys on your backend and perform the POST requests there, however for sake of simplicity, we do it here in the application.


```sh
npm install
npm start
```
